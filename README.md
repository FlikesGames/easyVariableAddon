# Easy Variable Addon
Addon for easy variable access via text value


## What is that?
Sometimes there are too many variables in a project. Often you have to do many checks to change one value. For example, in the picture you can see an approximate situation. To change points for one player, I first need to set the condition that the function includes exactly the parameter you expect.

It would be easier if you could access a variable directly using only its name. Then you could shorten your code significantly.

The picture is for illustrative purposes only, but you get the idea.
